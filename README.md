# NBA-Veteran_Analysis

## Concept
The goal of this project is to help front offices evaluate veterans when adding to their roster to bolster championship contention. I am creating a predictive model to evaluate player decline over the upcoming seasons. The model will apply a variety of player evaluation metrics per season dating back to the 1980s to map player improvement and decline which will be the features. The model will then predict player drop offs for the 2019-2022 seasons using a player decline metric I have created. I will use cross-validation to remove a small subset of player training data for the 40 seasons tracked and apply it to the test data.
